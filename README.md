```

A lightweight, offline MP3 player for Android.
Built with performance in mind and powered by Flutter and Rust.

- **Flutter (Riverpod for state management)**: Reactive, scalable state management for playback, library, and settings.
- **Rust core via FFI (`flutter_rust_bridge 2.x`)**: High-performance file indexing, metadata extraction, and playlist persistence.
- **Just Audio / Audio Service**: Foreground media session, background playback, interrupt handling, and Android Auto / notification controls.
- **Shared preferences with caching**: Fast, low-latency setting access with a singleton cache wrapper.
- **Optimistic UI updates**: Instant feedback for playlist/favourites changes with rollback on failure.

### 📖 Architecture Deep Dive

| Layer | Description |
|---|---|
| **Pages** | Feature screens: songs, favourites, playlists, search, settings, and shell navigation |
| **Providers** | Riverpod providers for songs, playlists, theme, settings, shuffle/repeat modes, and UI flags |
| **Audio Handler** | `PlayerAudioHandler` extending `BaseAudioHandler` with session restoration, custom actions (`toggle_shuffle`, `toggle_repeat`), and media browsing support |
| **Low-Level Wrapper** | Clean-architecture adapters over Rust calls for data sources and repositories |
| **Rust FFI** | Core library for media file scanning, song collection, playlist CRUD, and process music tasks |

### 🚀 Quick Start Checklist

- Run `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` after modifying providers
- Run `dart run flutter_rust_bridge` after modifying Rust source files or `#[flutter_rust_bridge::frb()]` annotations
- Ensure `LowLevelInitializer.init()` is called before any Rust-bound provider is accessed
- Use `ref.read(provider.future)` in `initState`-like flows; prefer `ref.watch()` in widgets
- Always wrap Rust calls in `try/catch` or Riverpod error handling due to potential FFI boundary failures
- IDs from Rust are `BigInt` — never cast to `int`; use `BigInt.parse()` / `.toString()` carefully
- Keep Alive (`keepAlive: true`) on library/audio providers to prevent cold-start re-fetching
